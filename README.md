## Make Your Cute
#### by Sherry Lam



### Overview
My project, “Make Your Cute”, is an interactive web piece coded using p5.js where you can customize your own cute buddy from a selection of choices. I wanted to explore the question of why cute things are cute. Psychologically, our reaction to anything cute comes from the characteristics of babies and our needs to take care of them. In doing so, I have included a printer in my installation to allow users to print their cute buddies into stickers and keep or share them. 

### Technical Details

This uses a bunch of p5 libraries:
p5.clickable for clickable buttons
p5.2DAdventure to manage all the states
p5.debugScreen
